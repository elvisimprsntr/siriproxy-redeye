siriproxy-ipcam
===============

About
-----
Siriproxy-ipcam is a [SiriProxy] (https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy) plugin that allows you to push IP camera images to Apple's Siri interface on any iOS device that supports Siri.   It does not require a jailbreak, nor do I endorse doing so.

First, you must have SiriProxy installed and working.  

Second, you must have at least one IP camera on your local network that supports image/video streaming.  

Here is a short demonstration video: Coming soonâ€¦   

Cameras
-------

Hopefully the documentation for your IP camera provides the URL for grabbing a still image.  If not, while I have not found a single resource that documents all the make and model IP camera image URLs, this site is a good reference: http://www.ispyconnect.com/sources.aspx

BTW, The Windows open source [iSpy security camera software] (http://www.ispyconnect.com) is the best I have come across.  While there are no Mac OS X or Linux versions, the source code is avaiable and they are adding support mobile device HTML5 access.  

Installation
------------

- Navigate to the SiriProxy plugins directory  

`cd ~/SiriProxy/plugins/`

- Get the latest repo   

`wget "https://github.com/elvisimprsntr/siriproxy-ipcam/zipball/master"`

- Unzip the repo  

`unzip master`

- Create a symbolic link. **Note: Replace #'s as appropriate.**

`vim siriproxy-ipcam\lib\siriproxy-ipcam.rb`

- Copy the repo and the symbolic link to the appropriate install directory.  **Note: Replace #'s as appropriate.  Replace /usr/local/rvm/ with ~/.rvm/ depending on your Linux distribution**
